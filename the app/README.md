the app - A project app to manage wikipedia watch list for specific articles, using scraping by SELENIUM chromedriver and Gui with Tkinter .

The scraping is for that blue-bar element label [pageviews.wmcloud.org/pageviews](https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/pageviews/?project=he.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&redirects=1&start=2022-03-07&end=2022-03-07&pages=%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%9F_%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%9F_%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%93).

I wrote this app in order to manage my own articles I wrote, by make it easier for me to follow how many people watch them.

to be improved : 
* [ ] to excel all txt files, for easier file managing
* [x] using Tkinter input window, instead of the command prompt. 
* [ ] to be on tray
* [ ] managing time of check - GUI check box, or toggle button for daily automatic check
* [ ] without using chromedriver.exe
* [ ] single py file for the scraping
* [ ] tooltip https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/whatever/tkinter+tooltip
