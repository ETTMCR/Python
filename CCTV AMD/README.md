🖥️ + 🎥 + 👁️👁️ CCTV AMD - a ( wiil for an open source) project for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) suffers. The idea is to create CCTV via webcam input, in order to ease reading, instead of buying expensive commercial setups (such as the [DaVinci Pro Desktop Electronic Video Magnifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KK6qxrCp08)).
Using mostly the OpenCV & the Tkinter modules.
