A small script changing gibberish written in English, istead of Hebrew, and put it in the last copied clipboard.
e.g. tbh tuvc keuss == אני אוהב לקודד
First you need to copy the string you want to change, and then execute, you'll hear Beep tone, and than paste it.
In order to use this script in windows, you need to make this file to be executable, then make shortcut, and then make shortkey for the shortcut.
