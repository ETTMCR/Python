:heavy_check_mark: gibberish fix - A small script changing gibberish written in English :uk:	, instead of Hebrew :israel:	, and put it in the last copied clipboard :clipboard: .

e.g. tbh tuvc keuss == אני אוהב לקודד

First you need to copy the string you want to change, and then execute, than you'll hear a Beep tone :musical_note:	, and than paste it.

In order to use this script in the backround of windows, you need to make this file to be executable, then make shortcut, and then make shortkey for the shortcut.
